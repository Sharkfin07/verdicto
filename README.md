Verdicto helps you make decisions in life... If you don't have anyone (Pssst... you) better to make decisions for you. From deciding should you do homework or not, to deciding on who should you save in an emergency situation, you could always rely on Verdicto (Don't actually do tho).
> ( ! ) Don't use Verdicto unless you are a more horrible decision maker than a dice.

# Backstory
I have a crush on school, and I was really deciding if I should... get to know her better. One day, I was playing Super Mario 64 on the DS and stumbled across the flower petal plucking mini-game thingy. Eureka! A light bulb appeared over my head, and I made... This.
